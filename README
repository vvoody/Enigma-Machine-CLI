To have some ideas about what Enigma is, open enigma.html in some
browser supporting Java Applet.

EnigmaAppCLI.java is the only thing new since checkouted the original
source codes from http://russells.freeshell.org/enigma/ . It's used to
do the same jobs as the applet does but at command line.

The codes show how to do the algorithm without graphic interface, it
just outputs the decrypted string from a hardcoded plain text with
default settings. It is pretty simple, does not support setting from
the command line options like normal unix programs do. I did this just
because I have to finish the school assignment. And it's not so that
good using GUI to do some repeatable jobs.
